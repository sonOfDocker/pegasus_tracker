# Pegasus Tracker Frontend

This directory contains the mobile-first UI built with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).
The app is designed to visualize transactions processed by the data pipeline in
`pegasus_tracker`.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server (using Expo):

```bash
npm start
```

The application is configured for Expo so you can run it on Android, iOS or the
web using the Expo client.

## Project Structure

- `App.js` – Entry point for the React Native application.
- `package.json` – NPM configuration and dependencies.

This is a minimal scaffold to get started. Feel free to expand the structure as
the project grows.
