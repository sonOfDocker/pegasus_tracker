### Vision

Pegasus is a privacy-first personal finance platform that gives households a clear, unified view of their financial life.
By consolidating data from banks, credit cards, and vendors into a standardized model, Pegasus becomes a single source of truth for cash flow, spending behavior, and budgeting — while keeping users in control of their data and enabling future automation and intelligent analysis.

### Mission

Pegasus builds a reliable, modular finance pipeline that transforms fragmented financial data into clean, structured, and actionable insights.
The system prioritizes transparency, user control, and extensibility, delivering practical budgeting and spending analysis today while laying a foundation for automation, AI-assisted insights, and broader adoption in the future.
